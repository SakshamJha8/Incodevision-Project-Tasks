\# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering



This project was completed as Task 3 of my Data Science Internship at Incodevision. The objective was to perform Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing customer demographics and purchasing behavior, the project identifies distinct customer groups that can help businesses design targeted marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

\#Project Workflow



1\. Data Preprocessing



\- Loaded the dataset

\- Checked data types and missing values

\- Filled missing values

\- Removed unnecessary columns

\- Encoded categorical variables



2\. Feature Engineering



Created new features including:



\- Age

\- Total Spending

\- Children

\- Family Size



3\. Data Standardization



Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler to ensure equal contribution during clustering.



4\. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)



Reduced the dataset to two principal components for easier visualization while preserving the majority of the information.



5\. Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters



Used:



\- Elbow Method

\- Silhouette Score



to identify the optimal value of K.



6\. K-Means Clustering



Applied the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into meaningful groups.



7\. Cluster Analysis



Analyzed each customer segment based on spending behavior and demographic characteristics.
